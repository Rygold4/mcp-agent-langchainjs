# AI Agents, MCP, and Burgers with LangChain.js

Forget Skynet: your AI agents won't trigger an apocalypse; they'll just help you order the perfect burger. In this workshop, you'll build your own AI agent using LangChain.js that can answer questions, fetch menu info, and make suggestions—like a T-800 programmed for dining rather than hunting humanity.

With the Model Context Protocol (MCP), your agent can interact with all the necessary tools to accomplish its mission, from a Node.js API to a website for testing its culinary skills. The result: an autonomous, intelligent, reliable AI assistant that is thankfully harmless to the planet. 🍔

**What you'll learn**:
- Introduction to AI Agents and the Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- Using [LangChain.js](https://js.langchain.com/) to connect the model to MCP tools and create an AI agent
- Introduction to context engineering to enhance performance
- Building an MCP server to make a REST API usable by LLMs
- Creating a Node.js API to interact with our agent
- Building a website to test the chatbot
- Deploying the API, MCP server, and website on Azure with a CI/CD pipeline (bonus)

By the end of the workshop, you'll have a clearer understanding of what an AI agent and MCP server are, how they work, and ideas for using these technologies in your applications.
